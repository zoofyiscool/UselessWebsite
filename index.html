        <title>Goodbye - The Most Useless Website</title>
      <h1>It is the day I have decided to stop support for this project.</h1>
      <p>Reason being is because the website design is really outdated compared to some of my newer projects.</p>
      <p>Also the code is really messy and hard to maintain.</p>      
      <p>You can still visit the website though it will no longer be updated.</p>
